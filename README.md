## General info
This repository consist of 3 projects 
  
* Simple python problem solving
* Regression model
* Soil erosion detection

## Python problems
* Sum of number from 1  to N with limitations: 
    * N<=10^25
    * Execution time=0.1 seconds

## Regression Model
This project provides code to be able to train regression model using scikit-learn.

We have a dataset(internship_train.csv)  ready to model building with 53 anonymized features and a targer column.

We have to build model and  make prediction to (internship_hidden_test.csv) file.

## Soil erosion

We have 

	* Sentinel2 tile (T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2)  renamed to data.jp2
	* Masks 

We have to build soil erosion detection model with tensorslow

## Solution report Researh
	
	Proposals and result of research in different papers about soil erosion detection problem. 
	
	In other words - what can help to solve problem in the most effective way.
