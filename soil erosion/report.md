# Causes ,Effects, and Solutions to soil erosion

	Soil erosion  is ,at its core, natural process.Simplt put,it is when topsoil,
	which is the upper-most layer of the ground,is moved from one spot to another.
	
	Why this matters is because topsoil is the part of  ther land
	that is highest in organic matter and best suited for farming and other fertile activities,
	which is why soil erosion can have ther greatest impact on farmers and agricultural land.
	
	When farming activities are carried out, 
	the topsoil is exposed adn is often blown away by wind or washed away by rain.
	
	When soil erosion occurs,
	the movement of the detached topsoil is typically facililated by  
	either a natural process-such as wind or water movement-or by the impact of man, 
	such as through tilling framland.
	
	The process of soil erosion is made up of three parts:
	
		* Detachment: This is when the topsoil is actually “detached” from the rest of the ground
		* Movement: This is when the topsoil is relocated to another area
		* Deposition: Where the topsoil ends up after this process

## Various causes of soil erosion

* 1.Rain and Rainwater Runoff
During heavy rains,soil erosion is common.First of all, the water starts to break down the soil,dispersing the materials it is made of.
Typycall,rainwater runoff will impact lighter materials like silt,organic matter and finer sand particles,but in heavy rainfall,this can also include ther larger material components.
* 2.Farming
When land is worked through crops or other agricultural processes, it reduces the overall structure of the soil, in addition to reducing the levels of organic matter, making it more susceptible to the effects of rain and water.
Tilling in particular, because it often breaks up and softens the structure of the soil, can be a major contributor to erosion. Farming practices that reduce this activity tend to have far fewer issues with soil erosion.

* 3. The slope of the Land
The physical characteristics of the land can also contribute to soil erosion. Important terrain characteristics for soil erosion are slope gradient, length, aspect and shape.
For example, land with a high hill slope will perpetuate the process of rainwater or runoff saturation in the area, particularly due to the faster movement of the water down a slope.

* 4. Soil Erodibility
The susceptibility of soil to the erosion is determined by inherent soil properties, e.g., texture, structure, soil organic matter content, clay minerals, exchangeable cautions and water retention and transmission properties.
Soil erodibility estimates the ability of soils to resist erosion, based on the physical characteristics of each soil. The principal characteristic that affects erodibility is texture.
However, organic matter, structure, and permeability also contribute. Soils with faster infiltration rates, higher levels of organic matter, and improved soil structure are usually found to have greater resistance to erosion.
Loam-textured soils, sand, and sandy loam usually tend to be less erodible compared to very fine sand, silt, and certain clay-textured soils.

### Impressive Solutions to Soil Erosion

 When it comes to finding solutions for soil erosion, the most useful techniques found tend to be those that emphasize reinforcing the structure of the soil and reducing processes that affect it.

* 1. Careful Tilling
Because tilling activity breaks up the structure of the soil, doing less tilling with fewer passes will preserve more of the crucial topsoil.

* 2. Crop Rotation
Plenty of crop rotation is crucial for keeping land happy and healthy. This allows organic matter to build up, making future plantings more fertile.

* 3. Increased Structure For Plants
Introducing terraces or other means of stabilizing plant life or even the soil around them can help reduce the chance that the soil loosens and erodes. Boosting areas that are prone to erosion with sturdy plant life can be a great way to stave off future effects.

* 4. Water Control
For those areas where soil erosion is predominantly caused by water – whether natural or man-made – specialized chutes and runoff pipes can help to direct these water sources away from the susceptible areas, helping stave off excess erosion.
Having these filters in particular areas rather than leading to natural bodies of water is a focus to reduce pollution.

* 5. Soil Conservation
Soil conservation can be defined as “the combination of the appropriate land use and management practices that promotes the productive and sustainable use of soils and, in the process, minimizes soil erosion and other forms of land degradation.”
Various measures for soil conservation are primarily meant for the prevention of soil loss or reduced fertility caused by acidification, over usage, salinization or other chemical soil contamination.
Different techniques for improved soil conservation involve cover crops, crop rotation, planted windbreaks, and conservation tillage and affect both fertility and erosion.
